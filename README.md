============

Essentially, Pidgin for Chrome. A Chrome app that mimics the functionality of Pidgin, placing all messaging services in one place in a cross platform framework.

This app should have the following features:
============================================

- Easy to install or Build as a Chrome/Chromium extension
- Mimic the current Hangouts app (floating)
- Place itself above the most recently selected bubble of Hangouts (as a floating circle)

Expected limitations:
=====================
- Some apps do not offer an exposed API and there is a requirement of having certain apps installed (similar to Skype's Pidgin plugin)
- Funding: this will be a project of pure passion since the developers invovled cannot be compensated.
